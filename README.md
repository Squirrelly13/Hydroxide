# Hydroxide
Welcome to the Chemical Curiosities™ Repository!!

.

main Branch is the version currently pushed to the workshop, 

Experimental Branch is a funtional build of the game that is worked on before being fully pushed, 

and Development Build is where the mod is actively worked on, which means it may not be entirely functional compared to the other two. 

.

(2023 branch is old as hell, from before the 2023 refactor. This branch is not recommended for use nor is it ever touched by anyone)

.


.

It is recommended you use the Experimental Branch as that is the version that will consistently be updated with changes (though these changes are pushed to main, there can be a bit of a delay)

This mod is owned by Squirrelly, based off and containing the legacy mod Arcane Alchemy by Evaisa
