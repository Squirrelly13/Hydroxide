Hi, @UserK here (like the hit-person from discord!!)
This mod has undergone a very large refactor in the past, so there are still a few stray files here and there. We believe we've caught out all the issues caused by it, but let us know if you spot anything out of place!

Credit:

Squirrelly, for making the mod and adding the vast majority of CC features (she also made Flasky and the mod thumbnail!)

Evaisa, for the original Arcane Alchemy mod, on top of which CC was built off of, as well as everything related to the Mystical Mixtures branch, as well as doing some work on CC from time to time

UserK (me), for breaking the mod and then putting the files back together in a (hopefully) more coherent and understandable state (as well as doing general maintenance and additions here and there)

Lamia, for going through the entire mod and replacing many instances of deprecated function with newer more optimised/stable ones


+ loads of people from the Noitacord for answering my stupid questions. I personally had no idea what I was doing when I first joined CC so I hope my additions, modifications and fixes are to your liking!
