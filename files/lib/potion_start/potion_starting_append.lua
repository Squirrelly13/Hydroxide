									-- UserK's Super Handy-Dandy Starting-Potion Lib! --

	simply override "data/scripts/items/potion_starting.lua" with the "potion_starting.lua" file and then append the file location with your tables and merge functions


	appending should look something like:

	ModLuaFileAppend( "data/scripts/items/potion_starting.lua", "mods/your_mod/file/path/to/your/custom_starting_potion_appends.lua" )


	then your "custom_starting_potion_appends.lua" should have local tables that you then merge into the global tables found in the library. Examples can be found below:

-- THIS IS PRIMARILY GOING TO BE SHOWING HOW TO APPEND THESE LISTS, IF YOU WISH TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW THEY WORK, LOOK AT THE LIBRARY FILE FOR COMMENTS EXPLAINING



local ps = PotionStartingLib --we do this at the beginning so we dont have to deal with the really long "PotionStartingLib" all the time

--append staterpotions:
local modded_starterpotions = {
	{	probability = 8,		"epic_modded_material"},
	{	probability = 4.5,		"less_epic_modded_material"},
	{							"honestly_kinda_crap_modded_material"} --probability is an optional field that will default to 10 if left nil
}
ps.starterpotions = ps.CombineTables(ps.starterpotions, modded_starterpotions) --format for combining tables should be lib_table = combine_tabless(lib_table, modded_table)
--this table probably doesnt need to be altered much since its mostly comprised of more mundane materials like waters, blood, mud etc, but its up to you


--append magicpotions:
local modded_magicpotions = {
	{"awesomium"}, --even if you arent using probability, each material should be contained within its own table
	{"lamium"},
	{"averagium", probability = 30}, --adding probability fields is optional for starterpotions, magicpotions, and failpotions
}
ps.magicpotions = ps.CombineTables(ps.magicpotions, modded_magicpotions)
--this is the main table I would recommend appending, add a couple magical liquids that you think would be interesting to start a run with here



----- ^^^ this is basically all the average modder needs to care about. look below for some additional funny things ^^^ ----







--append one_in_millions
local modded_one_in_millions = {
	{	key = 0,	"existium"}, --"key" can range from 0 to 100,000
	{	key = -1,	"non_existium"}, --anything outside this range cannot be found
}
ps.one_in_millions = ps.CombineTables(ps.one_in_millions, modded_one_in_millions)


--append failpotions
local modded_failpotions = {
	{"just_death"} --idk i ran out of funnies, this just appends like any of the other functions, this one's fairly self-explanatory. Probability is also optional here
}
ps.failpotions = ps.CombineTables(ps.failpotions, modded_failpotions)

local modded_functions = {
	function(outcome) --if christmas, 2024, then replace water outcome with santanium

			if outcome == "water" then return "liquid_goober" end 		--if water, replace with liquid_goober
		end

--this effectively acts as an override, runs outside the main potion_a_materials() function and runs directly after it within the init() function
