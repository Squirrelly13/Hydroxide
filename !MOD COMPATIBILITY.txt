---There are a few places we support compatibility!!

--- VIALS:
---     append [Hydroxide/files/arcane_alchemy/items/vials/vial_populate.lua] with a script that add your material to the global table "vial_materials"
---     like so:
table.insert(vial_materials, {
    material = "fuckshit_mat1",
    weight = .8
})


--- PANDORIUMS:
---     Pandorium:
---         You can add your own spells to Pandorium by appending [Hydroxide/files/arcane_alchemy/materials/pandorium/random_spell.lua]
---         The table you adds your spells to is "Pandorium_projectiles"
table.insert(Pandorium_spells, "mods/modid/file/path/to/your/spell.xml")
---
---     Unstable and Chaotic:
---         If you do not want your spell to be cast by Pandorium at all, add the "pandorium_ignore = true" variable to your spell
---         Unstable Pandorium can cast any spell in which "related_projectiles" is not nil and "pandorium_ignore", "ai_never_uses" and "recursive" are all false
---         Chaotic Pandorium can cast any Projectile, Static Projectile or Material spell in tiers 0-2 and modifiers in tiers 0-5 unless they have "pandorium_ignore" or "ai_never_uses"
---             Chaotic Pandorium also has special detection for Glimmer spells, we check for "COLOUR" in the name of a modifier but ideally we'd prefer if mods could add the "is_glimmer" value to their spell
