# Known Bugs
Tinker Effect does not work
- Does not grant TWWE effect
- likely broken by Epi2 counter system? need to look into vanilla implementation or Apotheosis tinker crystals

# Requires attention
Mod Settings
Null Trip effect is lacking proper visual audio effects
Add material damage to Hydroxide Ice
Fix Veilium effect being too snappy
Ores Rework (speckles and chunks)
Look over Pixel Scene generation
- Make sure it respects Branch Configuration
Clean up Status Effect Icons
Clean up material textures

# Planned Expansions/Reworks
Fluent Fluids branch
- Remaster of Fluid Dynamics (has been approved by creator of Fluid Dynamics)
- Focus on Gaseous "Magic Vapour" variants of magical liquids
- I want the gasses to generally go up, so that's where the "Magic" part of "Magic Vapour" comes in lmao
- Biome modifier for Hiisi Base which replaces all the canisters with Magic Vapour canisters
- Powder Variants
  Dry Water.
 - Candy Variants
 - Powder Rainbow is "Failed Product" and Candy Rainbow is "Blessed Pebbles"

- Materia Mushrooms
 - Focus on adding new material mushrooms in a few places of the world
 - Overhaul Overgrown Cavern to have a node-based biome system that decides the type of fungi and mushrooms that spawn there

- Uranium Rework
 - It's unfinished and existing functionality should likely be reworked anyway
 - Uranium should be a material that is influential enough to make it worth taking "Radiation Immunity"
 - Should be rewritten from the ground up

- Alchemy Journal
 - Want to rework to have CC materials, then Vanilla materials, and finally contain modded materials from other mods
 - Need to rewrite its functionality from the ground up
 - Want it to be much more in-depth and have features like Advanced Search and Tabs for individual mods, etc
 - Rework page gain system to be based on reactions and completing puzzles? perhaps make it so rarely reaction notes can rarely spawn to help people who are struggling with the alchemy system, or to point them towards a material they might not know exists yet

- Anvil of Destiny Compatibility
 - Note: finish AoD rework before doing this

- Rewrite Chaotic Pandorium
 - Write a custom slimmed down gun.lua system that is more efficient and doesnt calculate unnecessary things like CD and RT

- Terror Branch
 - Terrifying version of CC that adds horrid materials
 - Terrifying Water
  - Material that is identical to water but turns into something nasty when the player gets close (based on world seed)
 - Terrifying Pandorium
  - Unstable Pandorium but with some modifiers similar to Chaotic Pandorium
 - Terrorportium
  - Teleportatium but it actively finds the most dangerous place to send you within the vicinity
 - Giga Slicing Liquid and Omega Slicing Liquid
  - Advanced version of Slicing Liquid, materials already developed and released in the Noita.Fairmod
 - Runestone of Terror
  - Converts nearby liquids into Terrifying Pandorium

# Miscellaneous Ideas & Features
- Add more Iron Stomach interactions (Veilium blocks blindness, Twitchy Liquid blocks Twitch debuff, Frozen Meat blocks Colour Blindness)

- Runestone of Spells
 - Convert Liquids to Pandorium

- Local Failshift
 - Triggers a small Local Shift when in close proximity to a dangerous material

- Subway Surfer.
 - Additionally: Rappa.

- Buff Frostburn
 - Should make you temporarily immune to Freezing Vapour

- Spectroleum
 - Gives an effect similar to Terraria Shimmer
 - Infinite flight for duration of effect, though movement is slower and sorta floaty/watery
 - Is a more refined/pure version of Ectospasm
 - Wanna have a driveable vehicle which runs on this and goes through walls and stuff
 - Name is a combination of Spectre and Petroleum

- Material which grants increased Max HP status
 - Stain effect give you (1 + Stain%)x Max HP (so 100% effect makes you have 200% Max HP)
 - Ingestion just gives full buff for an amount of time

- Pop up liquid
 - Gives status that spawns popups on your screen
 - Want material to look staticy, planning to make an Unsafe patch that stops the Material Hoverbar resetting every time the material under it changes
